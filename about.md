When I was fourteen I started playing with a real computer, a Commodore 64. It was 1984 and I decided that I would become a programmer. I've never looked back.

After three decades of software development and about twenty years of professional experience across all Europe and Middle East, now I'm a business partner, software developer and consultant at the [__Soft__Instigate](http://www.softinstigate.com) Team.

You can learn more about me also reading [my old blog](http://camelcase.blogspot.it), looking at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maurizioturatti) and following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkj6).
