    <p>As I have a long-term experience as a remote worker, also dealing with and managing remote teams in different timezones, I am always interested in experiences on this subject. Today I stumbled upon an article on TheNextWeb:&nbsp;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/10/05/3-radical-habits-highly-successful-remote-teams/" target="_blank">3 radical habits of highly successful remote teams</a>.
        Despite the article seems to be nice with remote workers, it actually contains what I think are some of the worst possibile anti-patterns for remote work. In summary:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Total transparency about yourself with your remote team</li>
        <li>Leave your webcam on all day</li>
        <li>Replace physical space with software — lots of it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let's rephrase the meaning:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I don't care about your privacy at all, so I want to know even when you are sleeping or pooping ("<i>For example, every Buffer employee receives a Jawbone UP wristband that tracks how you’re sleeping and shares that with the team."</i>)</li>
        <li>I don't trust you at all, so I want to check that you are always staring at a computer screen, all day long (<i>"This provides a persistent, passive view of your colleagues that makes you feel like you’re in the same room, working together at the same table."</i>). So you are even required to broadcast you scratching your nose or your privates: I can only imagine the level of anxiety!</li>
        <li>Additionally, I also want to mess up with your work by asking you to install, learn an manage a lot of different software doing, more or less, the same thing ("lots of it"). So that I can annoy you from even more different angles!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I, instead, suggest the following:</p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Hire people you trust</b> and let them organize their daily routine and priorities</li>
            <li>Adopt few, useful, simple software like Skype, Google Hangout and Slack for communication, Google Docs and/or Confluence for shared documentation.</li>
            <li>If you want a social life go to the gym or to the pub, switching off your mobile email notifications. <b>Get a life outside your work</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Managing a remote team like being into a modern edition of Orwell 1984? No, thanks. A remote, distributed team is not an assembly line: I suggest to move toward measuring people by the actual value they generate instead of the time they sit in front a PC.</p>
    </p>

    <p>A team made of knowledge workers must generate tangible value: if you can do that while playing tennis or having a shower, I don't really care.</p>
