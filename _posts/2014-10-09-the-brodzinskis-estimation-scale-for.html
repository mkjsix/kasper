    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/pawelbrodzinski" target="_blank">Pawel Brodzinski</a>, lean and agile coach, suggests a intriguing estimation scale for a task:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">1: 1</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">TFB: Too Fucking Big</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">NFC: No Fucking Clue</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    Despite the fact this could initially looks like a joke, it's actually a serious way to handle too large user stories and, from my point of view, it's very close to what has been suggested by other agile coaches like <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_killick" target="_blank">Neil Killick</a> (<a href="http://neilkillick.com/2014/07/16/my-slicing-heuristic-concept-explained/" target="_blank">My Slicing Heuristic Concept Explained</a>), especially popular within <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoEstimates" target="_blank">#NoEstimates</a> practioners.</p>
    <p>
        The idea, at least at high level, is very simple: slice down your tasks until they are all more or less of the same size (1 story point), then your final estimation is just a matter of summing the total number of stories. Of course, it's easier said than done: too many misunderstand the NoEstimate practice, dismissing it as just a way to avoid the "hard work", but in reality the slicing activity forces a very accurate analysis of requirements, to be able to slim them down to a common size. The easy part is the final sum, but that's not the point.
    </p>
    <p>In my opinion this method suggests that, when somebody says a user story is 5, 8 or 13 points in size, this implies a good amount of&nbsp;delusion, because in reality going beyond a 1, 2 or 3 size is so close to pure guessing that it is usually a waste of time. Using only a single size (one) it's even more effective, because forces a serious decomposition of tasks: if you can't achieve this level of decomposition then you should acknowledge that your requirements are not clear enough yet: drastic, but effective.
    </p>
    <p>A practical approach to this kind of user stories slicing could be <a href="http://gojko.net/2012/01/23/splitting-user-stories-the-hamburger-method/" target="_blank">Gojko Adzic's hamburger method</a>, when adding the constraint that each task composing the hamburger must be of size 1.
    </p>
    <p>Many years ago I did something vaguely similar in a project: I decided that every user story had to fit into a week and every Friday was release / demo day. Not exactly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery" target="_blank">continuous delivery</a>, but I think it was even before the term "agile" was invented...
