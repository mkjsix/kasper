    <p>
    While reading an article on ZDNet titled "<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/open-source-its-true-cost-and-where-its-going-awry-by-monty-widenius-7000016024/" target="_blank">Open source: Its true cost and where it's going awry by Monty Widenius</a>" I think I have realized why most people, even those tightly involved in the open-source ecosystem, are often misunderstanding its <i>business</i> <i>model</i>.
    In a sentence:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>The open source model is about creating collaborations, not building products.</i>
    </blockquote>Advocating open source software since the early 90s, from my point of view an open-source business model related to products can be misleading.
    <p>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"The problem is — I saw this very clearly with MariaDB — I created a company where I took the original people who were creating the product, [but] I couldn't get anybody to fund us,"</i> Widenius said.</blockquote>
    <p>
    Before being bought by Sun for an&nbsp;astronomical&nbsp;amount of money (1 billion $), <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> was profitable but in the range of few tens millions per year. You don't meet every day somebody putting billions on the table...
    </p>
    <p>My question is: what would force a company to pay for a product if they can have it for free? I guess <a href="http://www.redhat.com/" target="_blank">RedHat</a> owners asked themselves the same questions when they practically closed the RHEL product line source code, moving the community toward the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> project. And now RedHat is making an huge amount of money from a product that is, by all means, the (almost) closed version of an open source effort.
    </p>
    <p>So, it is really hard to build open source products, like RedHat or Alfresco, for example, because, despite all the efforts to justify a dual licensing model, you cab grasp only a very small percentage of users available to pay for a commercial edition of any open-source software. Stressing the fact that going into production requires paid support can be helpful, but it's very hard to demonstrate where the break-even is. Somebody coud argue: is that product so buggy that I need to pay a lot of money for support? Very few companies have been&nbsp;successful&nbsp;in this.
    </p>
    <p>Instead of selling standalone products, I see an easier&nbsp;path in building solutions and services on top of an open source ecosystem: companies and their developers collaborate in growing a set of tools, frameworks, libraries with an open source development model and communities. This allows to dramatically decrease R&amp;D costs, sharing the benefits. Today I could build a whole enterprise platform with open source software only, from the operating system to middleware and client applications, probably with better quality than a closed counterpart. But, as&nbsp;Widenius seems is learning the hard way, building an open source product and having paying customers is a different story: <a href="http://www.alfresco.com/" target="_blank">not impossible</a>, of course, but very hard.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq">Widenius again: "<i>Open source is successful for <a href="http://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> where you have a consortium of companies that are all putting money into developing it.</i>"</blockquote>Exactly what I mean: join to develop the common parts, share the costs and then compete in selling some unique services. But a stand-alone, open source product, created and supported by a single company, is a different story.
