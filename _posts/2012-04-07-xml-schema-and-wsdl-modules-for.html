    A couple of years ago I wrote a <a href="http://camelcase.blogspot.it/2010/07/xml-schema-and-wsdl-modules-for.html" target="_blank">blog entry</a> about how to install the missing <a href="http://xml.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">XML Schema Editor</a> and related utilities from the dev update center in Netbeans 6.9. Now there is a unofficial update center:
    <br />
    <br /><a href="http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/xml/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/updates/updates.xml">http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/xml/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/updates/updates.xml</a>
    <br />
    <br />It contains the development branches of these and <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/xml_schema_editor_in_netbeans" target="_blank">instructions on how to install</a>, thanks to Geertjan Wielenga.
    <br />
    <br />I installed the plugin on Netbeans 7.1 [update: I installed it also in 7.2]&nbsp;and it seems to work, even if I did not test it intensively, primarily because these days I'm no more working that much with XML Schemas and WSDL files.
    <br />
    <br />There is an apparently disabled <a href="http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/xml/" target="_blank">Hudson project</a> for the XML Tools. Now, if you want to put this nice plugin back into the regular plugin repository,<b> <a href="http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=184379" target="_blank">please vote for this issue</a></b>!
