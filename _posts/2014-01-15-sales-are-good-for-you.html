    <p>
    I have just published the below presentation on Slideshare: half it's serious content, half it's just for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some of my best friends are present or former colleagues, most are developers but many of them are sales or marketing people. I was thinking about describing the often difficult relationship between software developers and sales people since many years now.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am lucky I had the opportunity to work with very smart people, both on sales or IT, with the exception of some occasional moron, of course.
    </p>
    <p>Hopefully you can recognize some common, funny pattern in the slides below.</p>
