    Today&nbsp;<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt Publishing</a> has published a <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/apache-maven-starter/book" target="_blank">little book</a> I have written in the last few months together with <a href="http://about.me/maoo" target="_blank"><b>Maurizio Pillitu</b></a>.
    <br />
    <br />The book is titled <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/apache-maven-starter/book" target="_blank"><b>Apache Maven Starter</b></a> and it's part of the Instant collection by Packt Publishing.
    Instant books are concise and focused technical guides, usually no more than 50 or 60 pages, providing the maximum amount of information in the quickest and most effective way.

    <blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Get to grips with a new technology, understand what it is and what it can do for you, and then get to work with the most important features and tasks.The book follows a starter approach for using Maven to create and build a new Java application or Web project from scratch.</i>
    </blockquote>

    I accepted the invite to write this book because, despite the huge amount of information already available on this subject, in form of other books and online material, when I started learning <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a> I was searching for more concise information. The book actually doesn't aim to be a complete reference, but a place to start from and a collection of pointers to additional information. So, it is the book I wished I could read years ago.

    <p>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Maven ultimately allows for the automation of the build lifecycle and independence from any IDE. You must always be able to build and test any Java project from the command line, using your favorite editor for coding. It is important to control exactly what libraries get distributed with Java projects and to have a standard project template and build process.</i>&nbsp;</blockquote></p>
    <p>
    <blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Instant Apache Maven Starter will concentrate the most useful information into one single, very compact source.</i>&nbsp;</blockquote></p>
